### Query Similarity Exercise

This project contains a Python script that:
- Embeds 10 sample text sentences
- Embeds a user query
- Computes cosine similarity between embeddings
- Prints the top-3 most similar texts

This exercise demonstrates the basic retrieval step used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
